# pug-sass

A simple starter template for building static sites using **pug** & **sass** running under **bun**
No build scripts or frameworks, just good old `Concurrent`, for running the dev server and watching for file changes.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

To watch:

```bash
bun run dev
```

To build:
```bash
bun run build
```

## TO DO
- Hot-reloading the dev server & browser tab when files change
